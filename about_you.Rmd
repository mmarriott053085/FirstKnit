# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
 I attended Mayfair High School. Yes, I graduated in the year 2003. I enjoyed my English literature classes and found math to be a bit challenging for me. English was always preferable at math as I enjoy reading over calculating equations. Though, I did like the challenge of math at times, as it kept me on my toes. Oddly enough, I excelled in history. I really liked learning about the Civil War and World War 2.

You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
  My computer is and HP. It runs on Windows 11. I would consider myself a 5, as I am moderately knowledgeable of computers. My internet connection is a bit slow at times, but still reliable enough for my basic needs.
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be?
